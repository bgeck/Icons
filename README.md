# Icons

Icons is a Unity based interactive experience I worked on with my Partner Katrina for the 2017 Outdoor Vision Fest. Paintings come to life and interact with the audience through gestures, and by following hte movements of viewers.  By using both Unity and a Microsoft Kinect, the experience is visceral and really engaging.
